# **Road Accident Analysis Project**

## **Overview**
This project analyses road accident data to uncover trends and patterns in casualties based on factors such as road type, monthly trends, road surface conditions, urban versus rural settings, and time of day. The insights derived can guide strategies to improve road safety and reduce accidents.



## **Features**
**Casualty Analysis by Road Type**: Identifies high-risk road categories such as single carriageways and urban roads.
**Monthly Trends**: Tracks casualty trends across 2021 and 2022 to highlight seasonal and temporal patterns.
**Road Surface Conditions**: Examines the impact of dry, wet, and frost-covered road surfaces on accidents.
**Urban vs. Rural Comparison**: Compares accident data in urban and rural settings.
**Daylight vs. Darkness**: Analyses casualty data based on lighting conditions.



## **Technologies Used**
**Excel**: For data cleaning, aggregation, and visualisation.

**GitHub**: For project documentation and sharing.



## **Key Findings**
1. **Road Type**: Single carriageways reported the highest casualties (309.7K), while slip roads had the least (4.7K).
2. **Time Trends**: October showed the highest number of casualties in 2021, while February 2021 had the lowest.
3. **Road Surface**: Dry roads accounted for the majority of casualties (279,445), followed by wet and frost-covered roads.
4. **Urban vs. Rural**: Urban areas experienced significantly more casualties (255.9K) compared to rural areas (162.0K).
5. **Daylight Conditions**: Most accidents occurred during daylight (305.0K).
